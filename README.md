### 🍯 Buzzing About Me:

I am a busy bee buzzing in the vast hive of eBPF (Extended Berkeley Packet Filter). Over the year, I've woven intricate honeycombs leveraging eBPF's versatility and its powerful applications, especially in the realm of security. It's been a sweet journey contributing to various eBPF projects, and now I'm fluttering around the development of a revolutionary security tool named **Tarian**.

🔐 **Tarian**: An innovative eBPF-based security tool, Tarian aims to redefine how we protect, detect, and respond to threats in the Linux landscape. With its real-time capabilities, Tarian leverages the power of eBPF to provide granular security monitoring and enforcement. Buzz back soon for more details!

### 🌼 Pollinating Ideas:

- Extending Tarian's capabilities to cover more attack vectors.
- Collaborating with the hive (eBPF community) to improve eBPF tooling.
- Exploring more innovative uses of eBPF beyond security.

### 💬 Let's Buzz:

- eBPF's myriad applications and its sweet nectar.
- Linux security and best practices.
- Open-source collaboration and community-building.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack:

- **eBPF**: Tracepoints, XDP, BPF Type Format (BTF), libbpf
- **Languages**: C, Go
- **Tools**: BCC, BPFtrace, bpftool, cilium
